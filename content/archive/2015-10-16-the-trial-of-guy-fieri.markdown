### High-Fives for Guy


If you have not yet heard (in which case you probably live under a rock), celebrity chef Guy Fieri is coming to the University of Michigan. Yes, _the_ Guy Fieri of the show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” is coming to campus. He makes his heavily anticipated appearance this Saturday, the day of the Michigan State game. No, this is not some strange celebrity plug; rather, it is an inspirational visit in which each student should revel. Some people who are devoid of happiness will question the validity of the chef’s visit, skeptical of whether or not his trip to Ann Arbor is worthwhile. I am here to tell you that this skepticism is far from necessary, and there are a variety of reasons why Guy Fieri’s visit to Michigan will prove itself to be nothing short of magnificent.

1: He inspires confidence. Just look at those frosted tips! Behold the all-enveloping glory of his facial hair. Google Guy Fieri, and you'll see a [picture](https://www.google.com/search?q=guy+fieri&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIlZL6p4DIyAIVDJeACh0HhgfI&biw=1440&bih=770#imgrc=LzbO762PGbpU7M%3A) of him wearing a black collared shirt with blazing flames printed on it...now that's cool. Rumor has it he went to a Backstreet Boys Concert, decided that he liked what he saw, and never showered again. Let’s face it—you’ve never done you as much as Guy Fieri has done him.

2: He bounces back from rejection. Here are a few sentences from a [review](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html) of Guy Fieri’s restaurant, Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar: “When you saw the burger described as ‘Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creekstone Farm Black Angus beef patty, LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,’ did your mind touch the void for a minute?” As you can see, these are not kind words. The reviewer even had the audacity to question Fieri’s expertise in the Tex-Mex genre in saying, “How did nachos, one of the hardest dishes in the American canon to mess up, turn out so deeply unlovable?” The critic goes on, asking, “Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish?” With a review like this, I am surprised the chef ever picked up a spatula again. Yet Guy Fieri would not be deterred in his quest to promote food across America. Yes, Guy Fieri is still on TV, spitting in your face from 40 states away. So, no, the cruel bite of the critic has not squashed Guy Fieri’s appetite, and this is something we should all see as inspiration.

3) He promotes eating, and eating is dope.

The aforementioned are all reasons why Guy Fieri is a celebrity that University of Michigan deserves and needs. Go Guy Fieri! Go Blue!


### Praying for a Miracle


My colleague may have convinced you about Guy Fieri's greatness, but I'm here to tell you that he's far from the truth. I'm an avid fan of the Food Network, but while Guy Fieri's show "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" seems like it’ll be a fun trip to "Flavortown," I can assure you that it is not.

Let’s take a look at some other Food Network stars. Who was a leading star on the channel before Guy took over? Emeril Lagasse and Anthony Bourdain, two visionaries whose impact on cooking media is still felt today. Beyond these contributors, you've got my girl Rachel Ray with "30 Minute Meals". Rachel Ray ensured that millions of soccer moms and dads across the nation would have enough time to give their kids a great home-cooked meal. You've also got the _goddess_ Ina Garten delivering culinary sermons straight from heaven. And how could I forget the 32-time "Throwdown! with Bobby Flay" champion Sir Robert Flay? He’ll take your grandmother’s cake recipe and make it better than she ever could. The Food Network was full of meaningful innovation and culinary excellence. That is, until Guy came around.

But enough about other Food Network stars; let’s talk about Guy’s greatest transgression. Remember when Justin Timberlake had frosted tips? Well, we all know that even someone as good looking as Justin Timberlake can't pull that off. So how on Ina Garten’s blessed Earth did Guy Fieri of all people think he could? Guy Fieri: the guy who wears fire shirts and looks like that kid in middle school who never stopped talking about going to Warped Tour. We all tried to forgive and forget what Justin did, but Guy Fieri brought all of our repressed memories back into the spotlight.

If Guy Fieri still shows up tomorrow morning ready to ruin Ann Arbor’s pristine reputation, please don’t acknowledge him. Just pretend like he’s not even there. Let's treat him like JT's frosted tips and maybe they'll both go away forever.
